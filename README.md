##File Handling in Java program to do operations of a text file: the operation will consist of reading from it, modifying and then rewriting the content, all the commands above will be given by performing all of this with Notepad, Java, Command Prompt and notepad file is typed:FileOperations.java and so the CMD commands start when writing all of that code and in using cd commands navigating into where all that has been written to go. The Java file is then compiled using javac FileOperations.java, which generates a FileOperations.class file, which is the executable bytecode. The execution of the program is initiated using java FileOperations, and the user is prompted to enter text that will be written to the file. The program creates a file named example.txt and writes the user input into it. Once the writing process is over, the program automatically reads the content from the file and displays it in the CMD window. The next step is to modify the file by appending additional text for which the user is again prompted to enter new content. The program then opens the file in append mode and writes the new text while making sure that the previous content is retained. Finally, after modifying the file, the updated content is read and displayed again on the CMD screen to confirm the changes. The program follows a structured approach using three main methods: writeFile, readFile, and modifyFile. The writeFile method starts a BufferedWrite, to write data to the file, the readFile method uses a BufferedReader to read the text line by line, and the modifyFile method opens the file in append mode to ensure new data is added without overwriting existing content. Exception handling is also implemented using try-catch blocks to manage potential errors such as missing files or permission issues. Through use of try with resources, there is automatic closure of file streams, thus avert memory leakage. Running of the program from CMD allows an individual to exercise hands-on to interact with how Java file operations are handled. The process would also include grasping how a simple text writer like Notepad is used for writing Java programs, thus depicting that even though one does not have an IDE, they may still write and run Java effectively. The System.out.println statements provide a clear user interface, guiding the user through each step, ensuring clarity while working with file operations. The functionality of the program can be further tested by manually opening example.txt in Notepad to verify if the text written matches the input given during execution. It explains file handling with practical exposure to how Java communicates with external storage, on which CMD and Notepad are usually the most essential tools without needing heavy development environments to compile and execute programs. This kind of interface would allow users to test the running of the program a few times to see what different inputs do to the file contents, which is an excellent practice for novices learning file handling concepts in Java. Moreover, by experimenting with different text entries and observing the file updates in Notepad, users can better understand the append and overwrite mechanisms within file operations. This simple yet effective program emphasizes the core principles of file handling, exception management, and resource handling in Java, reinforcing key programming concepts while using basic tools like Notepad and CMD.
